README file for ssh2
====================

WHAT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ssh2 is an incomplete drop-in replacement for the standard open-ssh client
found on many platforms. It is designed to use a single thread of execution
and have as few external dependencies as possible, as well as a reasonably
small executable size and memory footprint. Its initial code was shamelessly
lifted from the examples coming with libssh2, but heavily modified and
significantly extended. Call ssh2 without arguments to get a short usage
message telling you about the supported options. The command line syntax is
modeled after that of the open-ssh client.

WHY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ssh2 was born from the need of a ssh client program for a lightweight
GNU/Linux installation running on a certain small ARM system, under the
(false) assumption the dropbear ssh daemon came without an accompanying
client program. Even after finding out about dbclient we did not abandon
ssh2 and still feel it has its raison d'Ãªtre, and be it only for educational
purposes.

LICENSE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ssh2 is licensed under the terms of the MIT license or the WTFPL, at your
option. You should have received copies of the respective license documents
along with the software.

BUILD
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Though ssh2 was designed to work on one particular modern GNU/Linux
distribution and was written without portatibility as a major design goal,
it should be fairly straightforward to port it to other unixlike and/or
POSIX conformant operating systems.

Ssh2 depends on the following libraries to be present on your system:
  libssh2
  libz
  libcrypto and libssl
	- or -
  libgcrypt and libgpg-error
In case you want it to work with passphrase protected private keys you
should make sure your copy of libssh2 is built with libcrypto support,
not libgcrypt.

1. Build manually

Provided you have the necessary libraries and their respective header files
in a place where your toolchain is able to pick them up, something like
that should suffice to build ssh2:

  gcc ssh2.c net.c -DWITH_TUNNEL -lssh2 -lssl -lcrypto -lz -o ssh2

You may omit the -DWITH_TUNNEL, if you like to go without the port
forwarding features. This will somewhat reduce the executable size.
If you are curious or feel something is wrong you can throw in a -DDEBUG to
make ssh2 tell a bit more about what is going on.

2. CMake assisted build

Requires installation of the CMake build system, version >=2.6. In the 
project directory simply issue the following command sequence: 

  cmake CMakeLists.txt && make
  
You might also want to tweak the defines (see above) in CMakeLists.txt.
